Follow through
Make our dreams come true
Don't give up the fight
You will be alright
Cause there's no one like you
In the universe
Don't be afraid
What you're mind conceals
You should make a stand
Stand up for what you believe
And tonight we can truly say
Together we're invincible
And during the struggle
They will pull us down
But please, please let's use this chance to
Turn things around
And tonight we can truly say
Together we're invincible
Do it on your own
Makes no difference to me
What you leave behind
What you choose to be
and whatever they say
You're soul's unbreakable
And during the struggle
They will pull us down
But please, please let's use this chance to
Turn things around
And tonight we can truly say
Together we're invincible
Together we're invincible
And during the struggle
They will pull us down
Please, please let's use this chance to
Turn things around
And tonight we can truly say
Together we're invincible
